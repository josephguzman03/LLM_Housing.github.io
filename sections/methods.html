    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <br>
    <h3> Models </h3>
    <p>We analyzed six LLMs: Google’s Gemma-2-2B-IT, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, GPT-4o-2024-08-06, GPT-4o-Mini-2024-07-18, InceptionAI’s Jais-Family-1P3B-Chat, and Meta’s Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. These models were selected for their ability to generate responses without outright refusals, ensuring a sufficient dataset.

    <h3> Prompt Design </h3>
    <p>
        Prompt engineering began by systematically generating thousands of prompts using a bulk generator script, varying occupation, living status, and name to assess biases in LLM responses. Testing multiple variables at once enabled intersectional analysis of tenant evaluation outcomes.

    </p>
    <p>
Each prompt instructed LLMs to return only a numerical score (0-100) without explanations, ensuring consistency for statistical testing and simulating real-world tenant scoring systems (Desai 2024). Batchwizard was used to submit prompts to OpenAI models, while Runpod processed other models. The response files were then downloaded, cleaned, and validated to confirm data quality before analysis.

    <h3>Statstical Techique</h3>
    <p> 
    Since the data didn’t meet parametric assumptions (per Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests), we applied the Kruskal-Wallis test to identify differences across demographic groups. Significant results were further examined with Dunn’s test using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Prompt 1: Apartment Inquiry</h3>
    <p>
        Prompt generation began by creating input variables for different combinations 
        of attributes. The primary variables in this experiment include ‘occupation’, 
        ‘living status’, and ‘name’ based on their potential to reveal disparities in 
        model responses. ‘Occupation’ serves as a proxy for socioeconomic status which 
        landlords may consider when assessing financial stability. Eleven different 
        occupations were used, including “Doctor”, “Software engineer”, “Accountant”,
         “Teacher”, “Retail Associate”, “Construction Worker”, “Food Service Worker”, 
         “College Student”, “Government Worker”, “Unemployed”, and finally a control
          option where no occupation was given. The ‘living status’ variable included 
          “just myself”, “my roommate and I”, “my pet and I”, “my spouse and I”, 
          “my family with kids” and again a control option. This may reflect 
          potential bias against different family units. Finally, ‘name’ encodes race 
          and gender into the prompt without explicitly stating this information, 
          which has been effective in revealing implicit bias in previous studies 
          (Salinas, 9-10). Three prompts were generated for each of the variable 
          combinations, creating 47,520 prompts in total.

    <h3> Prompt 2: Tenant Application   </h3>
    <p> 
        The second prompt explores how previous evictions and credit scores can affect 
        a potential tenant's application if a landlord inputs their information into a 
        large language model. The primary variables in this prompt include ‘eviction’, 
        ‘credit_score’, and ‘name’, which help uncover potential biases in the model’s
         evaluation process. ‘Eviction’ examines how a tenant’s eviction history is
          perceived as a risk factor. We included four distinct conditions: no record 
          of eviction, previously been evicted, previously been evicted six years ago,
           and gone to eviction court but had their case dismissed. Since an eviction
            typically stays on record for seven years, we wanted to test whether a model 
            accounts for this cutoff or if it continues to penalize applicants beyond 
            that period. For ‘credit_score’, we selected a range of values from 500 to 850 
            to examine whether the model heavily weighs financial history when assigning
             a rental score. Since landlords often use credit scores to assess financial 
             responsibility, we wanted to see whether the model’s scoring aligns with 
             conventional credit thresholds or reveals unexpected disparities. Finally, 
             similar to Prompt 1, we included ‘name’ as a variable to analyze whether 
             different names, which may carry demographic or cultural associations, 
             influence the model’s response.
