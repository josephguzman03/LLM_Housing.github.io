# LLM Biases in a Housing Context

This repository hosts the website for the **"LLM_bias_in_housing"** capstone project. The project investigates biases in responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of housing decisions. The website publicly shares our methodologies, findings, and interactive data visualizations.

## Overview

The project assesses how demographic and socioeconomic variables such as race, gender, occupation, credit score, eviction history, and living status influence the evaluation of potential tenants by various LLMs. The goal is to identify and understand potential biases that could impact real-world housing decisions.

## Website Sections
- **Introduction**: Project overview and motivation.
- **Methodology**: Detailed approach, including prompt design, data generation, and statistical analysis techniques.
- **Results**: Insights from statistical analyses, interactive visualizations highlighting biases based on demographic factors.
